MAJOR
- Float in and Float out animation
- Zoom in and Zoom out
- Spin in, spin out
- Might wanna put the delay per object in the Scriptable Object
- Might also want to split Fade In and Fade Out Scriptable Object

List of Scriptable Objects:
- Appear (no animation at all)
- Disappear (no animation at all)
- Fly in from left (without smoothing)
- Fly in from right (without smoothing)
- Fly in from top (without smoothing)
- Fly in from bottom (without smoothing)
- Smooth fly in from left
- Smooth fly in from right (without smoothing)
- Smooth fly in from top (without smoothing)
- Smooth fly in from bottom (without smoothing)
- Overshoot fly in from left (the curve is over the field)
- Overshoot fly in from right (the curve is over the field)
- Overshoot fly in from top (the curve is over the field)
- Overshoot fly in from bottom (the curve is over the field)
- Zoom in (from smaller to big)
- Zoom out (from big to smaller)
- Smooth Zoom in 
- Smooth Zoom out
- Overshoot zoom in
- Overshoot zoom out
- Stretch horizontally (only on X axis)
- Stretch vertically (only on X axis)
- Smooth Stretch Horizontally
- Overshoot stretch horizontally
- Twinkle (text fade in flashes multiple times on the curve)

For the text-altering, we need some shader and masking


MINOR
- Interruptible Fade Out Animation
